## Major Hurdles / Unresolved Problems
1. [ ] Carousel sizing was giving me a ton of headaches. I really didn't want to use landscape aspect ratio images but didn't have a lot of luck getting the 16:9 images to display nicely. 
1. [ ] I couldn't get my CSS styling to render how I wanted it to. I wanted to keep the navbar items aligned left but in order to get the containers centered on the page I had to add global CSS styling and that seems to be overriding the nav styling no matter what I do.
